<h1>Hi, I'm Orlando! </h1>
ðŸŒ± I am Orlando, a Cyber Security student at Sheridan College pursuing my Honours Bachelorâ€™s degree. I am interested in all things pentest related but with a particular focus on internal infrastructure (Active Directory) and web application security. I also enjoy exploring vulnerabilities and researching CVEs.
